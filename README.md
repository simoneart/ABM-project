Exam project for the PhD course 'Agent-Based models'. Implementation of the SIR epidemic model on networks. <br>
The goal of the project is to compare the epidemic spreading on different network topologies and to study the trend of the S, I and R populations varying the parameters of the graph itself. 
A square lattice, a Erdos-Renyi, a Watts-Strogatz and a Barabasi-Albert networks are considered. <br>
